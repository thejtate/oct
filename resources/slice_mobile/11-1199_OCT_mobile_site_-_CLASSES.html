				<p>Designed for children 8 and above, this program focuses on broadening our student’s understanding of theatre arts through educative, hands-on participation in the production process. Through a variety of intensive workshops, activities, and lessons we concentrate not only on advancing general acting skills, but introducing our students to the varied aspects within the theatre, both on and off stage.  Young Company members will perform “ Peter and The Wolf “ with the Oklahoma City Philharmonic on March 04th at the Civic Center Music Hall and then  “Cinderella Outgrows the Glass Slipper” at OCT’s annual fundraising event , Fairy tale Ball, April 14th.</p>
